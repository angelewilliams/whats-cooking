<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![What's Cooking?!][product-screenshot]](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43621994/161454532-c8cd921c-c249-4021-8e18-b9d73df796e6.png)

What's Cooking? Its a question we all have had at some point or another, and its a question we were tasked to solve 
by Turing School of Software and Design. We were given a week to build a fully functional app using a given repo, 
combining HTML, Css, and Javascript to create a well built user experience.

With this application you are able to view a list of curated recipes and save them for future use. Users 
will also be able to add these recipes to a Cooking list, Which in further versions of the application 
they can use to do meal planning for their forseeable future.

We were tasked with utilizing data from an API as well as using Webpack for the first time in the Turing program.

#### Languages

* HTML
* Css

#### Frameworks/Libraries
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start with, clone down the Repo on to your local machine. 
Then, run NPM install in the console inside of that repository using this code.

  npm install 

after you have run npm install inside of your copy of this repo, run this code.

  npm start

This will run the webpack in the console so you can use the applications. after that is done, 
there will be a large line of code that has populated in your terminal.

Take the Local Host link from that and paste it into your URL in your browser. You should have the application set up and ready to use!
