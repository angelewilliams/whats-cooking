<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What's Cookin?!

### About The Project

[![What's Cookin?!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43621994/161454532-c8cd921c-c249-4021-8e18-b9d73df796e6.png)

What's Cooking? Its a question we all have had at some point or another, and its a question we were tasked to solve 
by Turing School of Software and Design. We were given a week to build a fully functional app using a given repo, 
combining HTML, Css, and Javascript to create a well built user experience.

With this application you are able to view a list of curated recipes and save them for future use. Users 
will also be able to add these recipes to a Cooking list, Which in further versions of the application 
they can use to do meal planning for their forseeable future.

### Built With

In this project, we used these tools to help build, maintain, and populate the Web Application
We were tasked with utilizing data from an API as well as using Webpack for the first time in the Turing program.

#### Languages
* Javascript
* HTML
* Css

#### Frameworks/Libraries
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Whats Cookin Starter Kit Api as provided by Turing

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start with, clone down the Repo on to your local machine. 
Then, run NPM install in the console inside of that repository using this code.

  npm install 

after you have run npm install inside of your copy of this repo, run this code.

  npm start

This will run the webpack in the console so you can use the applications. after that is done, 
there will be a large line of code that has populated in your terminal.
![Local Host Link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43621994/161456081-7910945b-f2df-4167-a487-3d40cf2498fe.png)

Take the Local Host link from that and paste it into your URL in your browser. You should have the application set up and ready to use!

### Using the Application

Now that we are all set up for the application, its time for its actual use! When you load into the page, You are met with a webpage with 
a couple basic features. The first is a nav bar, which will allow you to move between two pages, a saved recipes section and a section 
that displays all available recipes. In both of these pages you are able to filter by a couple different tags using the filters section.
Finally, we have the main event, the recipes section. this  section displays a brief overvew of each recipe, giving you a name, an image, and the 
ability to save and add them to a meal planning list through two buttons.  

![Main Page Application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43621994/161454532-c8cd921c-c249-4021-8e18-b9d73df796e6.png)

If you click on one of the recipe previews, you will be met with a popup that shows the details of the recipe. This includes a name, 
image and the save and cook buttons, just as in the recipe preview, but now with the addition of instructions and ingredients. at the
 bottom of the ingredients tab, you will even find a total (and reasonable)cost of the recipe so you can plan out the cost of your meals.

![Popup Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43621994/161584095-e1fb7d26-6f17-4430-bf75-3039e22b06f0.png)

Lastly we have the filter bar, the search bar, and the saved section, all areas of the page that allow you to curate your list of recipes.
When a filter is clicked, the page displays a list of only the recipes with the tag included in the filter. 

![Filtered Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43621994/161585934-b860c6b2-01f6-4330-97bf-6873f02ea448.png)

In the search bar. You can filter out  recipes by their name (currently, this is limited to be case sensitive and you have to search with the first letter capitalized).

Finally, the saved recipes section! This section is where your recipe is sent when you click the banner on a recipe, allowing you to save the recipe for later use.
This feature is the meat of what you can do with this program.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

When we use this application, we have a couple tools to utilize. we have the ability to filter based on tastes and needs. This application has all of the information
someone would hopefully need to successfully meal plan for their week, and adds the ability to create a saved list so that they can compile all of the information
in a customized list. this application will also have the ability to add to a cooked list, and that is logged into our road map.
